 # WhatsApp Chatbot
WhatsApp Chatbot is a simple chabot which responds to predefined messages . The chatbot is capable of receiving messages from WhatsApp, processing them, and sending responses back to the user using Gupshup as a API.
## Features

* Natural Language Processing (NLP): Many sophisticated WhatsApp chatbots are equipped with NLP capabilities, allowing them to understand and process user queries in a natural, conversational manner.

* Interactive Messaging: Chatbots can use rich media and interactive elements like buttons, quick replies, and carousels to provide a more engaging and intuitive user experience.
